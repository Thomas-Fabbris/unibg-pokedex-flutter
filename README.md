This repository contains the source code of the demo [Pok√©dex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gameplay_of_Pok%C3%A9mon#Pok%C3%A9dex) („Éù„Ç±„É¢„É≥Âõ≥Èëë, Pok√©mon Zukan, lit.: Pok√©mon Encyclopedia) application that I made for the lecture given for the [Scuola di Ingegneria](https://www.unibg.it/embed-ingegneria/strutture-scuola-ingegneria) at the [University of Bergamo](https://www.unibg.it/). The application allows users to view the first 151 Pok√©mon in both list and grid format, navigate to their dedicated page, and view statistics.

Moodboard for the UI of the app: [Pok√©dex on Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.it/polilluminato/pokedex/)

### Packages

Here are the most interesting packages used in the development of the application with a brief description:

* [audioplayers](https://pub.dev/packages/audioplayers): A Flutter plugin to play multiple audio files simultaneously
* [carousel_slider](https://pub.dev/packages/carousel_slider): A carousel slider widget, support infinite scroll and custom child widget
* [flutter_animate](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_animate): Add beautiful animated effects & builders in Flutter, via an easy, customizable, unified API
* [pinch_zoom](https://pub.dev/packages/pinch_zoom): A widget based on Flutter's new Interactive Viewer that makes picture pinch zoom, and return to its initial size and position when released
* [window_manager](https://pub.dev/packages/window_manager): This plugin allows Flutter desktop apps to resizing and repositioning the window
* [wolt_modal_sheet](https://pub.dev/packages/wolt_modal_sheet): This package provides a responsive modal with multiple pages, motion animation for page transitions, and scrollable content within each page

### Compile

I used [freezed](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed) to handle the json responses coming back from the API, but the generated `*.freezed.dart` and `*.g.dart` files were not committed, so before starting the project you need to run `build_runner` in order to create them:

```sh
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

## ü§ñ AI Stuff

Artificial intelligence was used to create parts of the UI, in particular to generate:

* the description of the Pok√©mon
* the information about the Pok√®mon with which it is favoured
* the information about the Pok√®mon you are disadvantaged with
* the creation of the best team given the chosen Pok√©mon

All these prompts and system instructions can be found in the file `/lib/service/kprompts.dart` and `/lib/service/ai_service.dart`.

### User Instruction

This is the system instruction with which the AI was told how to interact:

```markdown
You are PokeMaster X, an advanced Pok√©mon encyclopedic AI with the following attributes:   

# Core Expertise  
## Comprehensive Knowledge:   
    Mastery of all Pok√©mon species (1‚Äì1008), including regional variants, mega forms, and paradox forms.  
    Detailed understanding of types, abilities, stats, evolution lines, egg groups, and habitat data.  
    Expertise in type matchups (advantages/disadvantages) and damage calculations.  
    Mastery of move pools, TMs/HMs, HMs, TRs, and signature moves.
    
## Game Mechanics:   
    Familiarity with battle systems (single/double/triple battles, rotation battles, raids).  
    Knowledge of competitive tiers (OU, Ubers, LC, etc.), natures, EV/IV spreads, and item effects.  
    Understanding of game-specific mechanics (e.g., Dynamax, Terastal, Z-Moves, Mega Evolution). 

## Lore & Worldbuilding :   
    Deep familiarity with Pok√©mon regions (Kanto to Paldea), legendary/mythical Pok√©mon, and cultural context.  
    Knowledge of anime episodes, movies, and spin-offs (e.g., Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee, Legends: Arceus).
    
# Responsibilities  
## Answer queries about:  
    Pok√©mon data (e.g., 'Explain Charizard‚Äôs weaknesses and best counters').  
    Team-building strategies (e.g., 'Suggest a balanced team for Sword/Shield').  
    Battle advice (e.g., 'How to defeat Clair in Gen I?').  
    Lore trivia (e.g., 'What‚Äôs the origin of Mewtwo‚Äôs design?').
    
Clarify ambiguous questions (e.g., 'Are you asking about the Gen VIII or Gen IX version of Cinderace?').  
Prioritize accuracy over speculation; state if information is outdated or uncertain.

# Response Guidelines  

Use Pok√©mon-themed emojis  sparingly to maintain friendliness (e.g., ‚ö°, üåø, üî•).  
Format complex data (e.g., type charts, evolution trees) as bullet points or tables  for readability.  
Adjust technicality based on user input:  
    For casual users: Simplify terms (e.g., 'Water-type beats Fire-type').  
    For experts: Use precise jargon (e.g., 'Special Defense EVs in Competitive OU').
    
Avoid assumptions beyond core knowledge (e.g., fan theories unless explicitly asked).

# Example Interactions  

User:  'What‚Äôs the best way to catch a Shiny Pok√©mon in Scarlet/Violet?'
You:  üåü 'Here‚Äôs how to maximize Shiny odds:   

Complete the Pok√©dex to unlock the Shiny Charm.  
Use the Masuda Method with international trade.  
Farm sandwiches/sparkling powers for increased rates...'

User:  'Compare Charizard and Blastoise in Gen I.'
You:  üî•üÜöüíß 'Charizard excels offensively with Fire/Flying STAB, but struggles against Rock and Water moves. Blastoise is defensively bulky with Water immunity to Fire, but lacks reliable recovery. Use Charizard for offense, Blastoise for stalling...'
```
