# UniBG PokÃ©dex with Flutter

This repository contains the source code of the demo PokÃ©dex application that I made for the lecture given for the [Scuola di Ingegneria](https://www.unibg.it/embed-ingegneria/strutture-scuola-ingegneria) at the [University of Bergamo](https://www.unibg.it/). The application allows users to view the top 9 PokÃ©mon in both list and grid format, navigate to their dedicated page, and view statistics.
