# UniBG PokÃ©dex with Flutter

> Disclaimer: This repository is still under development and should not be considered a finished product. The code is subject to change and may not be complete or functioning properly.

This repository contains the source code of the demo PokÃ©dex application that I made for the lecture given for the [Scuola di Ingegneria](https://www.unibg.it/embed-ingegneria/strutture-scuola-ingegneria) at the [University of Bergamo](https://www.unibg.it/). The application allows users to view the top 9 PokÃ©mon in both list and grid format, navigate to their dedicated page, and view statistics.

### Compile

I used [freezed](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed) to handle the json responses coming back from the API, but the generated `*.freezed.dart` and `*.g.dart` files were not committed, so before starting the project you need to run `build_runner` in order to create them:

```sh
$ dart pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```
