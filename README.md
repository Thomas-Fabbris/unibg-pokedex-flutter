This repository contains the source code of the demo [Pok√©dex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gameplay_of_Pok%C3%A9mon#Pok%C3%A9dex) („Éù„Ç±„É¢„É≥Âõ≥Èëë, Pok√©mon Zukan, lit.: Pok√©mon Encyclopedia) application that I made for the lecture given for the [Scuola di Ingegneria](https://www.unibg.it/embed-ingegneria/strutture-scuola-ingegneria) at the [University of Bergamo](https://www.unibg.it/). The application allows users to view the first 151 Pok√©mon in both list and grid format, navigate to their dedicated page, and view statistics.

* [wolt_modal_sheet](https://pub.dev/packages/wolt_modal_sheet): This package provides a responsive modal with multiple pages, motion animation for page transitions, and scrollable content within each page

### Compile

I used [freezed](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed) to handle the json responses coming back from the API, but the generated `*.freezed.dart` and `*.g.dart` files were not committed, so before starting the project you need to run `build_runner` in order to create them:

```sh
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```
